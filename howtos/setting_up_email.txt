(04:06:28 AM) Steve Phillips: Next Steps
1. Go to your AWS EC2 control panel's Security Groups and open port 25
2. Get receive-email.py onto that server (the one that X points to)
3. Comment out 'PORT = 1025' and uncomment 'PORT = 25'
4. screen -S email
5. sudo python receive-email.py
6. Send test email to avb@X and make sure its contents are printed by receive-email.py
7. Tell GitHub to reset your password, then visit the URL spat out by receive-email.py to log into your new, better-named account
